# Overview 
This report delves into the development and analysis of an investment portfolio to 
explore key financial concepts and tools. The primary objective is to construct a unique 
collection of at least 10 stocks, conduct in-depth detailed market research, and 
evaluate their historical performance. Using programmatic financial data extraction, 
the analysis will cover aspects such as stock returns, risks, correlations, and the validity 
of financial theories like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Efficient Market 
Hypothesis (EMH). Through detailed visualizations and statistical assessments, this 
project aims to offer actionable insights to enhance investor decision-making 
 
For the analysis, I selected the U.S. Technology and Growth Stock Market, particularly 
stocks listed in the NASDAQ Composite Index. The NASDAQ is widely regarded as a 
technology-heavy index, composed of many of the world’s largest and most influential 
tech companies (Brock, 2024). The companies within this market are often characterized 
by high market capitalizations, rapid growth, and innovation in fields such as AI, cloud 
computing and e-commerce.
